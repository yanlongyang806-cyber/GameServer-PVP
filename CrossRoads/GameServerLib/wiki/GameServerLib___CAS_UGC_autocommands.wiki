__CATEGORY UGC settings
If zero, then playing UGC content is disabled. This is accomplished by GameServers returning empty UGC search results and players auto-dropping their UGC missions.


h4.UGCPlayingTimeFractionOfAverageAllowed (float) - (AccessLevel 9) [Notes|Command_UGCPlayingTimeFractionOfAverageAllowed_GameServerLib]
The fraction of the average playing time where UGC rewards will be nerf-ed down to the player's playing time, instead of using the average playing time.
This is to prevent exploits by author and friends that use hidden (or non-hidden) early exits from a mission.

Send an autosave if user enters Preview mode with unsaved changes
and it's been at least this amount of time since last autosave
(user disconnect always makes an autosave)

h4.UGCSearchCacheDurationInSeconds (int) - (AccessLevel 9) [Notes|Command_UGCSearchCacheDurationInSeconds_GameServerLib]
The duration in seconds that we will return a cached result


h4.UGCSearchCacheMaxWaitingEntities (int) - (AccessLevel 9) [Notes|Command_UGCSearchCacheMaxWaitingEntities_GameServerLib]
If non-zero, maximum number of waiting entities for a cached UGC search. After this number, we start returning empty results for the default search.
This only ever occurs during a login burst when GameServers are starting up for the first time. Once there exists cached search results,
they will always be returned instead of timing out any entities.


h4.UGCSearchCacheTimeoutInSeconds (int) - (AccessLevel 9) [Notes|Command_UGCSearchCacheTimeoutInSeconds_GameServerLib]
If non-zero, then the search cache will have a timeout on it where any waiting Entities are sent an empty search result
