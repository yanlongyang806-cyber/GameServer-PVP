h3.ProjectileEntityDef

*Costume* < PlayerCostumeRef >
-	the costume of the projectile

*Speed* < float >
-	the initial speed the projectile will start at, if negative will start at TargetSpeed

*Acceleration* < float >
-	the feet per second acceleration to get to target speed

*TargetSpeed* < float >
-	the target speed of the projectile

*Range* < float >
-	the range of the projectile before it destroys itself

*Lifetime* < float >
-	the time before the projectile will kill itself

*Gravity* < float >
-	the gravity applied. Gravity is applied downwards. A negative gravity will cause it to go upwards.

*EntityCollisionRadius* < float >
-	the collision radius that is used to detect collision with other entities

*WorldCollisionRadius* < float >
-	the radius used for collision against the world

*MaxHitEntities* < int >
-	the maximum number of entities this projectile can hit. 0 or less will make it hit every entity

*SurfaceObstructAngle* < float >
-	(degrees) the angle threshold at which the projectile will report an OnCollideWorld

*StepHeight* < float >
-	the height in feet the projectile will attempt to step over small curbs in the geometry

*HitsFriendlies*
-	if true, will collide vs friendlies

*HitsEnemies*
-	defaults to true- if true, will collide vs enemies

*LinearVelocity*
-	uses a linear velocity movement model, which better preserves velocity when hitting surfaces
-	and instantly turns towards targets

*HugGround*
-	If set, the projectile will attempt to snap downwards to make contact with the ground

*WallsObstruct*
-	walls are classified as 45 degrees of a vertical wall. 
-	walls always cause obstructions (onCollideWorld)

*HitsOwner*
-	if set the projectile will detect hits on the owner

*IgnoreHitWhileStationary*
-	if set, will not detect hits while not moving

*PowerOnHitEnt* < PowerDefRef >
-	the power that will fire when it hits another entity
-	targets hit entity

*PowerOnCollideWorld* < PowerDefRef >
-	the power that will fire when it hits a wall
-	targets nothing

*PowerOnExpire* < PowerDefRef >
-	the power that will fire when it expires due to range or lifetime
-	targets nothing

*PowerOnHitGotoEnt* < PowerDefRef >
-	the power that will fire when it expires due to range or lifetime
-	targets hit entity

*PowerOnDeath* < PowerDefRef >
-	the power that will fire when it expires due to range or lifetime
-	targets creator

*OnQueuedDeath* (multiple allowed)
-	expression that is called when the projectile would be queued for death

*OnExpire* (multiple allowed)
-	expression is called when the projectile expires due to range, lifetime,

*OnCollideWorld* (multiple allowed)
-	called when the projectile hits a wall that obstructs it

*OnHitEntity* (multiple allowed)
-	Called for each entity that is hit

*OnHitGotoEnt* (multiple allowed)
-	called on when the projectile hits the entity it was going towards

*ResetHitEntsTimer* < float >
-	the period at which the projectile will reset its hit list and re-hit entities

*DecrementNumEntitiesHitCounterOnReset* < int >
-	when fResetHitEntsTimer pops and removes an entity, also decrement the hit counter
-	this is default behavior

*InitialEntityHitDelay* < float >
-	an initial delay when the projectile gets created before it will start hitting entities

*ProjectileType* < Default | Beam > [#EProjectileType]

-	a new type of projectile that is a (currently)stationary beam

*AttachOnCreate* < Default | Owner | Target > [#EProjectileAttachOnCreate]

-	on creation, it attaches to
