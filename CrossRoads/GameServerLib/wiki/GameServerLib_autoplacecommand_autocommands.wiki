h4.AutoPlacementFitnessToCorner (AccessLevel 9) [Notes|Command_AutoPlacementFitnessToCorner_GameServerLib]
*Returns: float*
*Parameter 1: fMinDistance (float)*
*Parameter 2: fMaxDistance (float)*
*Parameter 3: strict (int)*
Description: Returns a heuristic of how close the given potential position is to a corner.
If the potential position is within the fMinDistance, 1.0 is returned.
If the potential position is further than the fMaxDistance, 0.0 is returned.
Otherwise a value between 0 and 1 is returned. The closer to 0, the further the corner is from the position.
Param: strict - signifies how strictly it determines if something is an appropriate corner/edge. 
A value of zero disables strict. 


h4.AutoPlacementFitnessToEdge (AccessLevel 9) [Notes|Command_AutoPlacementFitnessToEdge_GameServerLib]
*Returns: float*
*Parameter 1: fMinDistance (float)*
*Parameter 2: fMaxDistance (float)*
*Parameter 3: strict (int)*
Description: Returns a heuristic of how close the given potential position is to an edge.
If the potential position is within the fMinDistance, 1.0 is returned.
If the potential position is further than the fMaxDistance, 0.0 is returned.
Otherwise a value between 0 and 1 is returned. The closer to 0, the further the corner is from the position.
Param: strict - signifies how strictly it determines if something is an appropriate corner/edge. 


h4.AutoPlacementFitnessToEncounter (AccessLevel 9) [Notes|Command_AutoPlacementFitnessToEncounter_GameServerLib]
*Returns: float*
*Parameter 1: fMinDistance (float)*
*Parameter 2: fMaxDistance (float)*
Description: Returns a heuristic of how close the given potential position is to an encounter.
If the potential position is within the fMinDistance, 1.0 is returned.
If the potential position is further than the fMaxDistance, 0.0 is returned.


h4.AutoPlacementIsOnCorner (AccessLevel 9) [Notes|Command_AutoPlacementIsOnCorner_GameServerLib]
*Returns: int*
*Parameter 1: strict (int)*
Description: Returns true/false if the potential position is actually on a corner
Param: strict - signifies how strictly it determines if something is an appropriate corner/edge. 
A value of zero disables strict.

*Returns: int*
*Parameter 1: fDistToCorner (float)*
*Parameter 2: strict (int)*
Description: Returns true/false if the potential position is within a given distance to a corner. 
Param: strict - signifies how strictly it determines if something is an appropriate corner/edge. 
A value of zero disables strict. 


h4.AutoPlacementProximityToEdge (AccessLevel 9) [Notes|Command_AutoPlacementProximityToEdge_GameServerLib]
*Returns: int*
*Parameter 1: fDistToEdge (float)*
*Parameter 2: strict (int)*
Description: Returns true/false if the potential position is within a given distance to an edge. 
Param: strict - signifies how strictly it determines if something is an appropriate corner/edge. 
A value of zero disables strict.
